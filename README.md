# Equalizer

This project was implemented as part of the [Project11](https://matkatmusic.gumroad.com/l/Project11_Course) mentored course on Gumroad by MatkatMusic.  
While I wrote the code and developed the implementation myself, the conceptual foundation, guidance, and inspiration for this project came from the course created by MatkatMusic.
